Part 1 ASJP Dataset (Liqi Zhu)
----
1. Introduction
---
The purpose of Part 1 is to find the overall status for those languages we choose based on the population that use the language. (http://www.vistawide.com/languages/language_families_statistics1.htm)

|  Language Family  | 	Speaker Percentage|
|----|  ---  |
|Indo-European|	44.78%|
|Sino-Tibetan|	22.28%|
|Niger-Congo|	6.26%|
|Afro-Asiatic|	5.93%|
|Austronesian|	5.45%|
|Dravidian|	3.87%|
|Japanese|	2.16%|
|Austro-Asiatic|	1.77%|
|Tai-Kadai|	1.37%|
|**Total**	|**93.87%**|

We managed to download the dataset for each language family from ASJP database. 

2. Method & Processing Data
--
Our thought is to compare the Distance data within each language family. One dataset is with the numbers and the other is not.
```
#### Cygwin ####
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Indo-European.txt > IEwonum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Austro-Asiatic.txt > AuAwonum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Austronesian.txt > Awonum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Dravidian.txt > Dwounum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Japanese.txt > Jwonum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Niger-Congo.txt > NCwonum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Sino-Tibetan.txt > STwnum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Tai-Kadai.txt > TKwonum.txt
egrep -v '\sone|\stwo' < Afro-Asiatic.txt > AAwonum.txt
# Exclude numbers in dataset > Datasets without numbers.
```


With Programs for calculating ASJP distance matrices (http://asjp.clld.org/software). We managed to get the distance matrix for each language family.

```
#### Power Shell ####
 asjp62 < listss17.txt > output1.txt
 asjp62 < Indo-European.txt > IEall.txt
 asjp62 < Austro-Asiatic.txt > AuAall.txt
 asjp62 < Austronesian.txt > Aall.txt
 asjp62 < Dravidian.txt > Dall.txt
 asjp62 < Japanese.txt > Jall.txt
 asjp62 < Niger-Congo.txt > NCall.txt
 asjp62 < Tai-Kadai.txt > TKall.txt
 asjp62 < Sino-Tibetan.txt > STall.txt
 asjp62 < Afro-Asiatic.txt > AAall.txt
# Overall view of whole dataset and different language families with numbers.
 asjp62 < IEwonum.txt > IEall_won.txt
 asjp62 < AuAwonum.txt > AuAall_won.txt
 asjp62 < Awonum.txt > Aall_won.txt
 asjp62 < Dwounum.txt > Dall_won.txt
 asjp62 < Jwonum.txt > Jall_won.txt
 asjp62 < NCwonum.txt > NCall_won.txt
 asjp62 < TKwonum.txt > TKall_won.txt
 asjp62 < STwnum.txt > STall_won.txt
 asjp62 < AAwonum.txt > AAall_won.txt
# Overall view of whole dataset and different language families without numbers. 
```
```
cat IEall*.txt > IE.txt
cat AuAall*.txt > AuA.txt
cat Aall*.txt > A.txt
cat Dall*.txt > D.txt
cat Jall*.txt > J.txt
cat NCall*.txt > NC.txt
cat TKall*.txt > TK.txt
cat STall*.txt > ST.txt
cat AAall*.txt > AA.txt

sed 's/ \+/,/g' IE.txt > IE.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' AuA.txt > AuA.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' A.txt > A.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' D.txt > D.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' J.txt > J.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' NC.txt > NC.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' TK.txt > TK.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' ST.txt > ST.csv
sed 's/ \+/,/g' AA.txt > AA.csv
# Arrange data into CSV file
```
With the combination and calculation of the .CSV files, we are able to compare the ASJP Distance of each language familt with and without numbers.

3. Results
---
Example of Japanese
![image.png-528.1kB][1]

As showed above, values are mesured ASJP Distance data. We calculated the average standard for each family language family and then compare the Distance matrix with numbers and the one without. 
Then we repeat the process for the other language families.
The results of all language families are followed:

4. Conclusion
---
As shown above, the first thing we discovered is that language families have different features. Japanese was obviously the language family containing the most similar languages since ASJP Distance is the smallest. While all the other language families show different level of variance.
About the influence of numbers, Dravidian's Distance drops significantly, which means the number changes a lot in Dracvidian Languages. Thus to say all the language families with positive numbers of Difference means number changes less than other words in that family. And Negative number indicates number changes more.
As a conclusion, in Indo-European, Sina-Tibetan, Austronesian language families, numbers changes less. While in other language families numbers may change more than average. 

5. Comments
---
ASJP Database is useful, while the shortcomings are obvious. 
The first problem is that ASJP translated the language into ASJP code, and the ASJP Distance has no defenition of calculation either on website or in software instruction. We can only campare the numbers but we don't know where the number itself was calculated.
The second problem is that the program on the website for calculation of ASJP Distance works only for ASJP Format txt file with a strict rule, which troubles a lot when considering subsets. And the program takes so long to output. Not to mention the program is not modifiable.
Additionally, ASJP Database is not complete. For example, Altaic family is missing. And some language has missing values.
